\section{Future work}

\subsection{Relate nucleotide sequence composition to the features of fluorescence intensity profiles}
We want to build a regression type model, relating features of fluorescence intensity profiles to nucleotide sequence composition. 

\subsection{Simultaneous clustering and registration}
We want to extend the iterated registration algorithm to simultaneously register and cluster a set of fluorescence intensity profiles. Then we want to test how much of a difference in sequence composition is translated to detectable differences in intensity profiles. 

\subsection{Prove that iterated registration increases power more than any other existing algorithm}
This is the first time a registration algorithm has been put through a rigorous procedure to test improvement in power. This simulation study is considerably more complex than the ones used in the literature. We want to compare the power improvement of all the existing registration techniques with the proposed iterated registration algorithm. 

\subsection{Relate relationship between warping function and sequence composition}
In addition to building a model between fluorescence intensity profiles and nucleotide sequence composition, we also want to fit the features of the warping functions with sequence composition. This will answer if certain sequences are more susceptible to warping than others, when presented on a glass surface.
