\frametitle{Simultaneous Registration and Clustering}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eliminate outliers by using ``data-depth''
\item Check if multiple clusters is better than one $\bar{\rho}_{\{\phi_1, \phi_2\}, N} > \bar{\rho}_{\phi, N}$
\item Model based, or k-means to get initial clusters, based on pairwise distances between curves
\item Estimate the medians, and ajust the clusters based on distance between medians and cluster members
\item Register to the median, re-evaluate the distances between medians and cluster members
\item Iterate until not much improvement in overall similarity index
\item Goal: To maximize $\bar{\rho}_{\{\phi_1, \phi_2\}, N}$
\end{enumerate}
